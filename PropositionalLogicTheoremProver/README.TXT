PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC THEOREM PROVER
		BY: Cassie Kresnye


ABOUT THIS PROGRAM
This function takes in propositional logic axioms and a negated conclusion. Then, through the resolution rule, the program can determine whether a proof is possible to solve, and if so, gives the axiom to solve it. This is done through proof by contridiction. 

RUNNING THIS PROGRAM
To run, simply scroll to the user input section. Define any axioms in the format given in the notes section, and run them in the pltp function.

ABOUT THE PROJECT AS A WHOLE
The Good: Was a lot of fun when I actually had time to work on it! Was defintely challenging enough.
The Bad: Whatever propositional logic Barry covered was lost in me since freshman year, so it took a bit to actually understand how the program was suppose to work. I'm still a little unsure about how it all works.

I do plan on doing A level after tonight!

DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL

2.27.16 - 4ish pm
woooo first day! I plan to get to C level today, starting with getting all my basic design stuff figured out.

2.28.16 7ish pm
So I need to read directions better. Completely solved a different problem, so gonna restart now..

2.29.16 3:30pm
So I'm pretty sure I just won the award for solving the most wrong problems. I sadly have to do over quite a bit BUUUUUTTT I can save at least some of my code from this past time. At least hana saved me from going any further. So, I'm going to write my resolver function now, the RIGHT WAY.

So I finished the resolvable? function, and it works great! Once you get back, work on the resolver functions to actually create the next axiom.

9:22pm
Alrighty, ready to knock Resolver out. Gonna do that now!

Resolver Works. In the morning, I need to create the test to see if any contridictions exists in the created axiom.

3.1.16 7ish pm
Started working again, made a contridiction? function to pass the a whole path into.

9:18pm 
HAHAHAHA it wooooorked!!! ahhhhhhh.... finally, C level is done. Well, at least after I test the online data given, will do now.

10:50pm 
So testing was horrendous, but it works decent now. I did have to add a function that looks specifically for contridictions in singles, because I kept running into issues. For now, that works, but will try to improve that when I try for A level AFTER tonight...
