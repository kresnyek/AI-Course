Missionaries and Cannibals by Cassie Kresnye

ABOUT THE PROGRAM
This program produces a possible solution to the missionaries and cannibals problem. It does this through
the use of states and successor functions that are processed by a search. This search can be one of 3
kinds, breadth first, depth first, or bnb (kinda). The search is passed in, so you can even write
your own if you want! (though given that only one person reads this, i'm guessing not).

NOTES:
The bnb method really just sorts the smallest to the front and that's about the only difference. So, I
suppose a better name for it would be "PUT-THE-SMALLEST-IN-FRONT-THEN-DFS", but that's not fun
